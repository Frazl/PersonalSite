Form Simplification

My cousin recently called over to the house as he was in the vicinity and we started chatting about technology. He is the offical DJI retailer for drones in Ireland and has recently grouped closely with the suppliers of drone flight training too. 
My cousin had the idea of finding a way to simplify the form he and anyone else flying a drone, must fill out, every single time they wish to fly a drone in Ireland.
The form is simple enough but is very time consuming as currently people have to hop from site to site to find information regarding longitude and latitude and bearing from the nearest air traffic control tower (ATC). They also have to submit a screenshot of a map with a bold red arrow displaying their takeoff area. 
I managed to simplify this with a guided application that would take the user from selecting a spot on a map all the way to a downloadable PDF and the required email of which ATC to send it to. 
The application is built with ReactJS on the frontend and bootstrap for styling as it was made to serve more as a proof of concept rather than anything super friendly. It is mobile friendly though! The site itself is hosted on my scaleway instance where I host most of my projects and it appears to be running pretty smoothly there on nginx. 
The most enjoyable thing about this whole project and most of my ReactJS projects is that they turn out to be static files that can be hosted on any webhosting provider and can run on any device which is why I really believe it to be the future. Especially with the developments of technologies such as React Native which is taking the code out of the browser and into native applications.
I currently have no future plans of this application as of yet but there is a possibility of turning it into a small business if the market is there for it as businesses are required to fill these out too and also must store records of this document. 
I will keep this article updated with any further business developments.
